# About Us

Under the GoI's new scheme of transforming India into a developed nation by 2047, the adoption of a 'phygital' (physical+digital) future, where digital technology reshapes the physical world is vital to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. 

At YuvSrijan, we aim to provide a **(digital)** platform for school/university students to submit such ideas under one roof. We will be forming a community at the school/university **(physical)** level for the students who are active in developing either technical or social skills in our society; just like this, we will provide a platform for them to translate their ideas into reality.

--PROBLEM STATEMENT

The main problem we wish to address is to provide community engagement among students under various organisations (school/college) so that people can align with similar ideas, and like-minded individuals and also learn from real-life heroes and changemakers already existing in our society.

The working of YuvSrijan can be demonstrated as:
1. Connecting Students by developing a web portal
2. Providing more student engagement
3. Guidance: Our portal can connect students with other students and well as domain experts, and provide resources, workshops, or training programs to help them develop their ideas into actionable plans.
4. Mentorship: Pairing students with mentors who can provide expertise, advice, and encouragement can be invaluable.
5. Financial resources: Grants, scholarships, or crowdfunding opportunities to help students secure funding for their projects.
