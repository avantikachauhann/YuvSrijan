# About Us

Under the GoI's new scheme of transforming India into a developed nation by 2047, the adoption of a 'phygital' (physical+digital) future, where digital technology reshapes the physical world is vital to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds. 

At YuvSrijan, we aim to provide a **(digital)** platform for school/university students to submit such ideas under one roof. We will be forming a community at the school/university **(physical)** level for the students who are active in developing either technical or social skills in our society; just like this, we will provide a platform for them to translate their ideas into reality.
